# SocialBuzz
Accenture Virtual Internship Project

This project is purely fictional

Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one
from London and the other from San Francisco.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted.

The goal is to categorize the data posted and reacted to on the platform by users while maintatining appropriate data practices for data collection and use.
